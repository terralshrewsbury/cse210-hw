When I get my tiny house built, I'm going to ask for extra shelf leaves.  2nd project:  Ingenious to have a pull out tray and added shelves on the tray.  The lid holder on the door is awesome.  I have my lids all jumbled together and your idea is much better");

My husband and I are about to purchase our first home and Iâ€™m totally going save these ideas! I currently use command hooks to hold my pot lids because Iâ€™m in a rental but I absolutely love the wooden holder also donâ€™t have to worry about the plastic hooks breaking after some time.
